## Swingbench Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Clone the repo to get the source artifact of `swingbench`

Change into the newly created swingbench directory and then either the "bin" directory
for Linux/Unix or the "winbin" for windows systems.

Ensure java (1.6 or later) is in your executable path.

You should then be able to run swingbench or any of the wizards.
